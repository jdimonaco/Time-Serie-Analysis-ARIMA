# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Climate-Change-using-ARIMA-Model

## Objective
This project aims to analyse of Earth's continuously warming climate. Using time series analysis to uncover hidden patterns in temperature data. The objective is to interpret the patterns and changes in Earth's temperature, a vital process in undertanding the impact of climate change and mapping out a cooler trajectory for the future.


## Motivation
The Earth's climate is changing, and the future feels uncertain. But what if we could peek ahead? Accurately predicting future temperature fluctuations is the key to preparing for the impact of climate change. This project excites me because it uses the ARIMA model, a powerful tool, to unlock the secrets driving our climate. Forecasting future temperature changes, empowering us to adapt and fight back against the effects of climate change.Using data, we can move beyond inspiration and create tangible solutions.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Develop an ARIMA model to predict future temperatures.
- Validate the modelâ€™s accuracy and refine it for better performance.
- Compare the results with other statistical models.
  
## Actionable Insights 
This project could pinpoint areas most at risk from future temperature changes which can help direct resources towards areas most in need of preparing for extreme temperatures.
